    <p>Dancing is my favourite hobby.I know 2-3 dance forms. Some of them are Kathak,Bharatnatayam,bollywood and a bit of Contemporary and Hip-Hop. I am always keen to learn new steps and new forms of dance. It is a good relaxation therapy for me as it calms my brain and restrengthens my body and empowers me to never stop. It is also a kind of good exercise for our body as while dancing our body parts move a lot , hence making our muscles more flexible and strong. According to me, it is a nice exercise these days to keep us fit and heallthy . As these days, we sit in front of the computer for long hours for our work. Hence, it is very neccessary to move around. Otherwise, there would be stiffness in our jonts and muscles.</p>
